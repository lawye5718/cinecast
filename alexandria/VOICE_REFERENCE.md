# Part 2: Qwen3-TTS VoiceDesign Experimental Findings

Empirical results from testing how the VoiceDesign model interprets voice description prompts. Maps the professional lexicon above to actual model behavior.

## Methodology

- All tests use the same 4 neutral sentences across all voices
- `instruct` field left empty to isolate voice description effects
- `seed: -1` (random) to test natural consistency
- Evaluated on: voice consistency across lines, adherence to description, quality
- Test scripts stored in `scripts/voice_design_strategies*.json`

## Round 1: Strategy Comparison

Tested 5 fundamentally different description approaches (M/F each, 40 samples total).

### Strategies Tested

| Strategy | Approach | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| **Anatomy** | Physical/acoustic traits | "A deep male baritone with resonant chest voice, smooth timbre, slight vocal fry" |
| **Persona** | Character identity | "A kind elderly grandfather who speaks with patience and gentle authority" |
| **Technical** | Audio engineering terms | "A well-projected male voice with crisp diction, moderate pace, controlled dynamic range" |
| **Emotion** | Emotional qualities only | "A calm, reassuring male voice that sounds confident, trustworthy, and steady" |
| **Context** | Scene/situation | "A male narrator reading a fantasy novel aloud in a quiet bookshop" |

### Results

| Strategy | Consistency | Key Observation |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Anatomy** | Best (M), Poor (F) | Physical descriptions give the model concrete acoustic targets. Female "light soprano, airy" pushed too high/thin. |
| **Persona** | Variable | Works when archetype strongly implies a vocal type (young journalist -> fast squeaky). Fails when ambiguous (grandfather -> gender switching). |
| **Technical** | Low-Medium | Model partially understands audio engineering terms but not reliably. |
| **Emotion** | Low | Too abstract. No physical anchor for what "calm" or "warm" sounds like. |
| **Context** | None | Different voice every line. Model treats description as scene direction, not voice identity. |

### Round 1 Conclusion

**Anatomy-first descriptions win.** The model needs concrete acoustic targets (pitch, register, timbre, texture) to produce consistent voices. Abstract qualities (emotion, persona, context) give too much interpretive freedom.

## Round 2: Anatomy-First Hybrid

All descriptions reformulated: register + timbre + tonal adjectives. No delivery/performance words (those belong in `instruct`).

### Formula

> **[register] + [timbre/texture descriptors] + [tonal character adjectives]**
>
> Never include: delivery verbs (speaking, reading), pacing words, scene/context

### Results

| Voice | Description | Consistency | Quality | Notes |
|-------|------------|------------|---------|-------|
| **WARM_BARITONE** | "deep male baritone, rich chest resonance, warm smooth timbre, hint of gravelly texture" | Med-High | High | Voice as described, very good deep quality, some variation |
| **GROUNDED_ALTO** | "female alto, full grounded mid-range, slightly husky, natural warmth" | Med-High | High | Follows description well, less variable than baritone |
| **BRIGHT_TENOR** | "male tenor, bright clear tone, light nasal resonance, youthful energy" | Very Low | High | Wild emotional delivery, "unhinged" quality — see Bright Tenor Investigation |
| **SILKY_MEZZO** | "female mezzo-soprano, silky even tone, soft rounded edges, gentle clarity" | Very High | Very High | Best overall. Extremely easy to listen to. |
| **COMMANDING_BASS** | "male bass, dark authoritative rumble, heavy low-end, firm tone" | High | High | Cowboy/western gruff quality. A keeper. |
| **CRISP_SOPRANO** | "female soprano, precise crystalline tone, balanced brightness, confident projection" | Very High | High | More tonal range but still consistent. Studio-quality feel. |

### Consistency Drivers (from Section I terms)

**High consistency** — terms the model locks onto reliably:
- Smoothness/evenness: `silky`, `even`, `soft`, `rounded` (from Smooth/Rich)
- Precision: `precise`, `crystalline`, `balanced` (implies control)
- Authority/firmness: `dark`, `authoritative`, `firm`, `commanding` (from Resonance)
- Grounding: `grounded`, `full`, `husky` (from Rough/Gritty + Resonance)

**High variability** — terms that destabilize:
- Energy: `bright`, `youthful energy` (from Brightness/Weight — see investigation below)
- Ambiguous warmth alone: `warm`, `deep` without anchoring texture

**Observation:** Female voices trend more consistent than male across all descriptions.

## Bright Tenor Investigation

Isolated the cause of BRIGHT_TENOR instability through systematic ablation (8 variants, 32 samples).

### Test Matrix

| Variant | Description | What Changed |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **CONTROL** | "male tenor, bright clear tone, light nasal resonance, youthful energy" | Original — baseline |
| **NO_BRIGHT** | "male tenor, clear tone, light nasal resonance, youthful energy" | Removed "bright" |
| **NO_ENERGY** | "male tenor, bright clear tone, light nasal resonance" | Removed "youthful energy" |
| **NEITHER** | "male tenor, clear tone, light nasal resonance" | Removed both |
| **BRIGHT_ONLY** | "A bright male tenor voice" | Minimal — just "bright" |
| **SHARP_REPLACE** | "male tenor, sharp forward-placed tone, light nasal resonance, crisp articulation" | Replaced "bright" with "sharp" |
| **HIGH_HARMONICS** | "male tenor, strong upper harmonics, clear forward projection, light nasal resonance" | Technical acoustic equivalent |
| **STABILIZED** | "male tenor, steady clean tone, light nasal resonance, even delivery" | Applied consistency formula |

### Results

| Variant | Consistency | Character | Finding |
|---------|------------|-----------|---------|
| **CONTROL** | Very Low | Unhinged, wild emotional swings | Confirms R2 behavior |
| **NO_BRIGHT** | Medium | Expressive but text-guided, less unhinged | "Bright" contributes emotional volatility |
| **NO_ENERGY** | Medium | Similar to NO_BRIGHT, one auctioneer pacing spike on dramatic text | "Energy" contributes pacing bursts |
| **NEITHER** | High | Follows text cues, stable | Bare tenor base is inherently stable |
| **BRIGHT_ONLY** | High | Stable, text-responsive | "Bright" alone is fine |
| **SHARP_REPLACE** | High | Annoyed/irritable quality | "Sharp/forward-placed" maps to irritated tone |
| **HIGH_HARMONICS** | Medium | Raised voice, near-shouting, very clear | Useful niche: alertness/wake-up effect |
| **STABILIZED** | High | Narrator-like, low emotion | Consistency formula works but flattens expression |

### Key Finding: Interaction Effect

**"Bright" and "youthful energy" are each stable alone but interact destructively.** The combination gives the model contradictory signals — tonal brightness (acoustic) + behavioral energy (performance) — and it flails between interpretations on every generation.

This is likely a general principle: **mixing acoustic descriptors (Section I) with behavioral/energy descriptors (Section III) in the voice description creates ambiguity.** Keep voice descriptions purely in Section I territory; use `instruct` for Section II-IV qualities.

### Term-Specific Mappings

| Term | Section | Model Interpretation | Usefulness |
|------|---------|---------------------|------------|
| `bright` (alone) | I. Brightness/Weight | Stable tonal brightness | Good in isolation |
| `bright` + energy terms | I + III | Emotional chaos | Avoid combination |
| `sharp` | I. Nasal/Sharp | Annoyed/irritable tone | Use carefully |
| `upper harmonics` | I. (technical) | Raised volume, near-shout | Niche: alertness effect |
| `steady`, `even` | I. Smooth/Rich | Narrator-like stability | Flattens expression |
| `silky`, `rounded` | I. Smooth/Rich | High consistency + listenability | Best for narration |
| `dark`, `authoritative` | I. Resonance | Gruff/western quality, consistent | Good for male authority |
| `crystalline`, `precise` | I. Smooth/Rich | Consistent with expressive range | Best balance |
| `hollow` (in instruct) | I. Resonance | Whisper/sigh hybrid, breathy emptiness | Avoid in instruct — model reads it as acoustic, not emotional. Use "defeated" instead. |

## Working Rules for Voice Description Prompts

1. **Lead with register** (bass, baritone, tenor, alto, mezzo-soprano, soprano)
2. **Add 2-3 texture/timbre terms** from Section I only
3. **Never mix acoustic (Section I) and behavioral (Section II-IV) descriptors** in the description field
4. **Use `instruct` for delivery, emotion, and pacing** — that's what it's for
5. **Prefer "control" terms** (`silky`, `even`, `precise`, `firm`) over "energy" terms (`bright`, `sharp`, `piercing`) for consistency
6. **Over-specifying with ambiguous terms compounds uncertainty** — minimal clear descriptions can outperform detailed ambiguous ones
7. **Female voices are inherently more consistent** in this model across all description styles
